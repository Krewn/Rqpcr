#The gold standard method for estimating DNA concentrations via qPCR is quantification cycle () standard curve quantification, which requires the time- and labor-intensive construction of a  standard curve. 

#Based on multiple verification through several labs running dilutions of independent sequences “MAK2-fitting is as reliable as  standard curve quantification for a variety of DNA targets and a wide range of concentrations.”

#(Pretty much disregards data past the inflection point.) Phase 1 of 3 provides

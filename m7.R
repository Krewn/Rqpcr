#General Equations in PCR described by Ruijter et al.   >>>
#  Most PCR data analysis methods assume the PCR efficiency to be the same for all samples per amplicon and PCR run. Indeed, the variability in observed efficiency values seems to reflect primarily a random error, and not a real variation (16)
#In the exponential phase of the PCR reaction, the amplification efficiency can theoretically be estimated from cycle to cycle as E = Nc+1/Nc
#Due to the noise in early cycles this approach focuses on the linear phase, (The second of the 3 phases in PCR amplification)
